Description:
All of the MW3 killstreaks(including cut ones) all recoded from GSC to InfinityScript. This is in a very early state, with only a small few streaks finished. 

Notes:
This was programmed using a private build of InfinityScript. As a result, there will be functions that do not exist in the public InfinityScript 1.5.
